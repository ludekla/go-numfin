## Numerical Methods in Finance with Go

# About

This repository implements the models described in the book

*Numerical Methods in Finance with C++*

by Zastawniak & Capinsky (Cambridge University Press, 2012)
in *Golang* as opposed to C++.

Because Go is not per se an object-oriented language in the way C++
is, the challenge is to find an approach better suited to Go.
What is more, we will try and keep the code as idiomatic as possible.
